Welcome to my web development project! This repository hosts a fully functional, interactive **Hangman Game** and my digital **Curriculum Vitae**.

## 🕹️ Project Overview

This project was built to practice DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript, and CSS styling. It features:

* **Dynamic Gameplay:** The game fetches random words from an API based on the length you choose (5, 6, or 7 letters).
* **SVG Animations:** The "Hangman" is drawn step-by-step using SVG lines for every wrong guess.
* **Timer Logic:** A countdown timer (15s, 30s, 60s) adds pressure to the game!
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both Desktop 💻 and Mobile 📱.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `index.html` - The main game interface.
* `mycv.html` - My professional resume (Education, Skills, Experience).
* `js/js4game.js` - Game logic (Fetch API, Event Listeners, Timer).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
